In the social revolution since modern times (thermodynamics + heat engine = industrial revolution, information science + computer = information revolution, etc.), advanced science (physics, information science, etc.) and innovative engineering (mechanical, electrical and electronic engineering, etc.) has revolutionized our society. The realization of the super smart society, which is also called the fifth social revolution, is not limited to the integration of physical space technologies such as machinery, electricity, and construction after the industrial revolution and cyber space technologies after the information revolution but requires the fusion of cutting-edge science and technology such as science and artificial intelligence. Quantum science is a discipline based on quantum mechanics that governs the smallest unit of material and energy, "quantum." The quantum computer that realizes massively parallel computing has dramatically improved the capabilities of artificial intelligence (such as deep learning). Also, it is expected that cryptographic communication will provide secure network technology and enable automated driving with IoT using quantum sensors with ultimate sensitivity. This educational program aims to realize the super smart society based on quantum science through a degree program that integrates master and doctoral courses, with the aim of cultivating super doctors who are professional of knowledge and capable for leading multiple sectors of the future super smart society.

To achieve this goal, in addition to teaching specialized courses where the students enroll, we will cultivate the following five skills essential for realizing the future super smart society based on quantum science.。

* Have fundamental knowledge in quantum science and artificial intelligence
* Cultivate science and technology in specialized fields related to both cyber space and physical space technologies
* Have the overall view of both quantum science and super-smart society
* Possess capabilities of solving multi-disciplinary social issues
* Demonstrate leadership in each sector of industry, government, and academia

Specifically, the following 13 measures will be implemented.

**【Cultivation of specialized academic ability & originality】**

* Quantum science and artificial intelligence basic subjects
* Cyber / Physical specialized subjects
* Cyber / Physical cross mentor system

**【Cultivation of social cooperation comprehensiveness】**

* Super smart society creation subjects
* Super smart society creation subjects

**【Cultivation of ability to solve interdisciplinary issues】**

* Interdisciplinary matching workshop
* Intensive practice for interdisciplinary research planning
* Super smart social basic technology research project
* Super smart society creation research project

**【Global leadership development】**

* Global leadership cultivation subjects
* Global forum for super smart society
* Global off-campus research project
* Overseas mentor system
