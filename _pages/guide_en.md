## Four Gates for Completion of the Course

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/assets/images/curriculum_eng.jpg" /></div><br>

**１．Enrollment Examination**

* **Students' Eligibility**

  To take the enrollment examination, one of the following requirements must be satisfied:

  1. A master student enrolled in the University who intends to continue the master course at the start of official study in this program.
  2. A master student or a doctoral student enrolled in the University who will start/continue the program at the doctoral course (limited).

  To take this curriculum, students must register and pass the enrollment examination. This exam is organized in March for Spring enrollment and in September for Fall enrollment. In addition, the student’s academic supervisor must provide written consent to apply.

  Students must complete the prerequisites before enrolling in this program. They must have completed at least six months of their master or doctoral programs and are required to take some courses of this program before enrolling. If students enroll during their doctoral program, the enrollment examination and mid-term examination can be conducted around the same time.

* **Selection Method**

  The selection test (enrollment exam) is evaluated based on the student’s motivation, research plan from master to doctoral course, and an essay on the relationship with a super smart society. Details and dates of the examination will be announced when available.

  To pass the exam, the following must be satisfied before starting this program:

  1. Acquired one or more credits from the cyber/physical off-campus project course group as specified or offered by the program (Table 1 in the [Study Guide](/doc/Guide_SSS_en.pdf)). The off-campus project credit can be obtained by taking an internship subject. If the acquisition of credits cannot be confirmed by the time of the exam, a project completion certificate from the organization where the off-campus project (internship) was conducted can be substituted.
  2. Participation in the Interdisciplinary Matching Workshop (Table 3-2 in the [Study Guide](/doc/Guide_SSS_en.pdf)) organized by the program.

**２．Mid-term examination**

* To participate in the doctoral course of the program, it is necessary to pass the mid-term examination.

Core academic ability for quantum science may be obtained by earning credits from lectures other than those listed in this table.


**３．Completion examination**

* To qualify for completion of this curriculum, students must complete their original doctoral course as well as satisfy the following qualification items:
  1. Acquire at least 10 credits from the subjects offered or designated by the program shown [here](/doc/Guide_SSS_en.pdf).
